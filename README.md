# Music To Your Weather
Yes, there're tons of weather apps on the market. But this might be one of the first apps to **match the music you listen to with the forecasted weather.**


## What's 'Music to Your Weather'?
### Inspirations
*Have you ever walked in the rain while thinking to yourself, "I wish there's some nice music for me to dance to"?*

*Or, do you keep coming back to that one fine Sunday morning, walking in the golden light of the rising sun with a nice cup of coffee in hand, but somehow you still sense the lack of some good melody?*

The inspiration for **Music to Your Weather (MTYW)** comes from such scenarios that everyone could resonate with. The Weather, to us human beings, is much more than the meteorological conditions, rather, varying weather conditions are inherently perceived by people from a subjective point of view and thus related to diffrent moods and feelings.

Starting with this observation, this web application offers to match music, a popular form of art creation to recreate scenes and feelings in the audience, with the forecasted weather.

Just launch the web app, and the matching song would pop-up to you with the latest weather forecast. So you know not only **if it's going to rain or not**, but you'll be confident that **you'll have the perfect song for that special moment in life.**
